[Strings]
EXPLAIN1 =Disables the ability to change the specified default handler (PDF viewer). \n\nThe UI configuration does not set any key in HKCU. Instead, changing the setting via the UI invokes the installer which sets the key in HKLM. The default application behavior varies depending on what is installed. A value of 1 disables the user's ability to change the default handler. Possible values include: \n0 (or null): Allow the user to change the default viewer. \n1: Don't allow the user to change the default viewer. \n\nGUI mapping - Edit > Preferences > General > Select Default PDF Handler
EXPLAIN2 =Disables automatic updates and removes associated user interface items.\n\nThis setting interacts with bDeclined.\n0: Disables and locks the Updater. Overrides any bDeclined value. \n1: No effect. \nSetting bUpdater to 0 disables the user interface items Preferences > Updater and Help > Check for updates.
EXPLAIN3 =Turns off and locks user participation in the feedback program and disables the UI that controls the feature. \n\nPossible values include: \n0: Disable and lock feedback program participation. \n1: Enable feedback program participation. \n \n\n
EXPLAIN4 =Specifies whether to show messages from Adobe when the product launches.  \n\nDetails: Possible values include: \n0: Don't show messages from Adobe when the product launches. \n1: Show messages from Adobe when the product launches. \n \nGUI mapping: Preferences > General > Show me messages when I launch Acrobat. \n
EXPLAIN6 =Locks the auto-fill functionality on or off and disables the corresponding user interface item.\n\nPossible values include: \n0: Lock auto-fill. \n1: Don't lock auto-fill. \n \nGUI mapping: Preferences > Forms > Auto Complete drop down list. \n
EXPLAIN7 =Specifies whether to use Protected View never (default), for files from an untrusted location (recommended), or always.\n\nThe PV preferences were implemented in Acrobat 10.1 and are supported in Reader with 11.0. Possible values include:\n0: (default) Disable Protected View.\n1: (recommended) Enable Protected View for unsafe locations only.\n2: Enable Protected View for all files.\nNote that the Customization Wizard 11 created the preference in an incorrect location at HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Adobe\(product name)\(version)\TrustManager. This bug is fixed in the Wizard DC.\n\nGUI Mapping: Preferences > Security (Enhanced) > Protected View radio buttons.
EXPLAIN8 =Summary: For Acrobat, caches whether the user has accepted the end user license agreement for the browser-based EULA (Acrobat only).  \n\nDetails: If the EULA is not accepted, the application cannot be used and the Updater is also prevented from running. Possible values include: \n\n0: Show the EULA because it has not been accepted. \n1: Don't show the EULA because it has been accepted. \n \n
EXPLAIN9 =Specifies whether or not to display the startup splash screen at every launch.\n\nPossible values include: \n0: Don't display the startup splash screen. \n1: Display the startup splash screen at every launch.\n\nGUI mapping: Splash screen
EXPLAIN10 =Toggles JavaScript execution on and off globally; when off, the PDF cannot execute JavaScript.\n\nWhen the user's ability to create privileged locations is not disabled and locked, end users can bypass disabled JS by choosing Trust once or Trust Always via the Options button on the Yellow Message Bar. Admins can disable and lock JS execution by setting bDisableJavaScript to 0 in HKLM.\n\nGUI mapping: Preferences > JavaScript > JavaScript panel > Enable Acrobat JavaScript
EXPLAIN11 =Specifies whether trust anchors should be imported silently or Acrobat should ask permission from the user.\n\n0: Enable and Ask before installing.\n1: Enable and Install silently.\n\nGUI mapping: Preferences > Security > Security Settings panel > Ask before installing checkbox
EXPLAIN12 =Specifies whether or not trust anchors should be periodically downloaded from Adobe.\n\nPossible values include:\n0: Don't load settings from an URL.\n1: Do load settings from an URL.\n\nPreferences > Security > Security Settings panel > Load security settings from a server
EXPLAIN13 =Elevates locations that Internet Explorer trusts to privileged locations so that they may bypass security restrictions.\n\nPrior to 10.1.1 and 9.4.7, trust was granted to Trusted Sites. With 10.1.2 and 9.5 and later, trust also includes Local Intranet zones. This setting essentially makes IE trust operate as if they were privileged locations. The feature can be disabled with bDisableOSTrustedSites.\n0: Don't automatically trust Windows OS zones.\n1: Do automatically trust Windows OS zones.\n\nGUI mapping: Edit > Preferences > Security (Enhanced) > Automatically trust sites for my Win OS security zones
